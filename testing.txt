## Test 1: Small Number of Threads 
command: make
time ./sloppySim 4 5 11 100 false true

Expectation: number of threads are relatively low, and work is I/O bound,
the threads should complete the work quickly. Overall execution
time should be reasonable. 

below is the output of my program. 

Simulation Parameters:
#threads = 4
sloppiness = 5
work time = 11
work iterations = 100
CPU bound = (false)
Do logging = (true)
Global Ct = 60Locals [15,15,15,15]
Global Ct = 120Locals [30,30,30,30]
Global Ct = 180Locals [45,45,45,45]
Global Ct = 235Locals [60,60,55,60]
Global Ct = 295Locals [75,75,70,75]
Global Ct = 345Locals [85,85,85,90]
Global Ct = 400Locals [100,100,100,100]
Final Local Buckets: 100 100 100 100
Final Global Counter: 400

## Test 2: Small number of threads and CPU/bound
command: make
time ./sloppySim 4 5 11 100 true true

Expectation: I am expecting this to run quite faster than I/O bound
from compared to test case 1. This will use the CPU and get the work
done quicker. 

below is my output for the program. 
Simulation Parameters:
#threads = 4
sloppiness = 5
work time = 11
work iterations = 100
CPU bound = (true)
Do logging = (true)
Global Ct = 400Locals [100,100,100,100]

Final Global Counter: 400

## Test 3: Large number of threads and IO bound 
command: make
time ./sloppySim 30 5 11 100 false true

Expectation: it should scale accordingly. I belive that it will take quite
some time to get done. But, still something managable and should be able to 
finish. 

below is my output for the program. 
Simulation Parameters:
#threads = 30
sloppiness = 5
work time = 11
work iterations = 100
CPU bound = (false)
Do logging = (true)
Global Ct = 455Locals [15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,20,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15]
Global Ct = 900Locals [30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30]

## Test 4: Large number of threads and CPU bound
command: make
time ./sloppySim 30 5 11 100 true true

Expectation: I feel here CPU bound comes into play. This program will finish quite
quicker than I/O bound here. And should scale really well. 

below is my output for the code.
Simulation Parameters:
#threads = 30
sloppiness = 5
work time = 11
work iterations = 100
CPU bound = (true)
Do logging = (true)

./sloppySim 30 5 11 100 true true  0.12s user 0.00s system 89% cpu 0.134 total


I am not testing Do_logging it's pretty self explanatory. It will work
like it's supposed to. 

NOTE: Even if it's false it will still print the local buckers and the
global counter. Just to make sure everything is good and working fine.
